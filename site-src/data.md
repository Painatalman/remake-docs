### How Remake stores data

Remake stores data in JSON files for each user.

It converts nested elements on the page into nested arrays and objects.

The only 3 data types Remake understands are:

* `Objects`
* `Arrays`
* `Strings`

#### For more information 

If you're curious about learning more about Objects, Arrays, and JSON, I'd strongly recommend reading these articles:
