### User Accounts

* User accounts are built in to Remake.
* User passwords are stored securely, using best practices (hashing & salting).

### Password Reset for Users

If you use the free Remake deployment service, password reset emails are also supported.

If you host a Remake app on your own, you can easily add your own email service to send password reset emails (more docs on this coming soon).
