### Why Remake?

Remake allows anyone to turn a static website into a dynamic web application in a matter of minutes.

Remake's authors believe **there should be more startups in the world** — it should be easier to create them! 

The web is a relatively new technology, with a lot of room for growth. What if your neighbor could create a web app in an afternoon? That would mean you could too. Then, the web would suddenly become a much more interesting place, exploding with new ideas! 

**Our goal is to foster a more open and beautiful internet**, so more companies and individuals can contribute to the whole ecosystem, connect, and learn from each other. 

❤️
