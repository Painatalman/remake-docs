## Introducing Remake

#### Let's build a Trello clone!

We're going to build a simple, but fully-functional Trello clone in about 30 minutes.

### Introducing Remake

Remake takes a simpler approach to web development.

1. You only have to learn ~9 new HTML attributes to build a full application
2. You only need to know HTML and [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp)
3. You retain complete control over your front-end design
4. User accounts, inline edit popovers, and persistent data are taken care of!

### How Remake's different

1. Most frameworks store data separately from your templates. Remake merges them. We call this "[flattening-the-stack](/flattening-the-stack)"
2. Remake is able to convert deeply nested HTML into deeply nested JSON
3. Remake treats HTML values as your app's source of truth. But it remains flexible with [flexible routing](/routing) and [advanced data saving](/saving). 

**Fun facts:** 

* Remake is SEO-friendly and more reliable because it's server rendered. 
* The Remake front-end framework isn't loaded if the current user isn't the page owner.
